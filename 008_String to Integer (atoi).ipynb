    "## 8. String to Integer (atoi)\n",
    "- Implement atoi which converts a string to an integer.\n",
    "- The function first discards as many whitespace characters as necessary until the first non-whitespace character is found. Then, starting from this character takes an optional initial plus or minus sign followed by as many numerical digits as possible, and interprets them as a numerical value.\n",
    "- The string can contain additional characters after those that form the integral number, which are ignored and have no effect on the behavior of this function.\n",
    "- If the first sequence of non-whitespace characters in str is not a valid integral number, or if no such sequence exists because either str is empty or it contains only whitespace characters, no conversion is performed.\n",
    "- If no valid conversion could be performed, a zero value is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "Input: str = \"   -42\"\n",
    "Output: -42\n",
    "Explanation: The first non-whitespace character is '-', which is the minus sign. Then take as many numerical digits as possible, which gets 42."
